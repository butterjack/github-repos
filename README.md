## Notes and Todos

- The graphql api only permits us to query certain number of repositories. This still an ongoing isuue in github. So I had to choose a limit number: 100.
  https://github.community/t/graphql-api-how-to-fetch-all-repositories-that-the-current-user-has-access-to/13792

- Although I built unit tests and end-to-end tests, the test suites is basic due to the simplicity of the task

- I used a lot of css formats: inline css, bootstrap and css files. That is because I am not a css wizard so for each case I use what I feel comfortable with. And This part of the project needs to be improved.

## Feedback

This test was really challenging for me for a lot of reasons; I am more focused into backend development and the test was a pure frontend test so keeping everything responsive and implementing a design from scratch took the most time. And as I said above I am not a css wizard, so the css in this project is not well formated.
